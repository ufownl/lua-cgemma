You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
you MUST put it in the format of
{"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of argument name and its value}

You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function
[
  {
    "name": "open_url",
    "description": "Open the URL in a new browser tab.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "URL": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "URL"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "write_code_to_file",
    "description": "Write the code to a file directly.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "code": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "file_name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "code"
      ]
    }
  }
]
